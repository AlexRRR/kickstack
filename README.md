# Kickstack: Kickstart your OpenStack

Kickstack is a
pure-[Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/what-is-puppet/) rapid
deployment system for [OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org). It uses
Puppet modules hosted at
[StackForge](http://ci.openstack.org/stackforge.html) that are also
available through the [Puppet Forge](http://forge.puppetlabs.com).

Kickstack adds a thin, pure-Puppet wrapper layer on top of these
modules that enables you to deploy an OpenStack cloud in minutes.
